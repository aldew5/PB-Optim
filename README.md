# Optimizing PAC-Bayes 
Using second-order methods to optimize PAC-Bayes bounds. This will be a flexible framework for optimizing different structured posteriors which has applications in many other domains.

To run noisy KFAC on the kfactored posterior:

``python3 train.py --optimizer noisy-kfac --approx noisy-kfac --precision float64``
